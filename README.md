# WebID
WebID Creation and Validation (Tutorial, Tools, Best practices)

# Why WebID?
WebID is a novel way to identify and authenticate users and organisations on the Web with established methods. The main advantages are:
* people and organisations become the main authority for their data with full control
* No need for passwords any more. Authentication is done with your own secure key

In comparison to any other services like Facebook, LinkedIn or OpenID you are the owner of the data and of the secure key and therefore your own authority.
The WebID workflow uses public/private key cryptography and client certifcate authorization to establish secure, authenticated HTTPS connections. 
We compiled a list of background reading at the end. 
 

# Terminology
WebID or WebID URI - The WebID itself is an identifier that represents a person or an organisation. In simple terms it is a self-chosen URI that can be used to retrieve additional information in form of the WebID profile document via the browser or with software (e.g. `curl`). Note the duplicate in WebID(entifier) and Uniform Resource Identifier (URI).     
Examples:

WebID profile document or WebID file - The WebID profile document is the file that is downloaded when you execute a HTTP(S) request  and contains the identifier and all relevant information about the person and organisation in particular the RSA Public Key used to verify authentification. The file is normally written in Turtle Syntax (RDF).

`#` fragment - In website URLs the `#` is used to jump to certain parts of a HTML page, usually a paragraph. In WebID, the URL of the WebID profile document is appended by a fragment `#this` or `#me` to distinguish between the URL of the WebID profile document (the whole file) and the identifier and data in the document (part of the file).  

Client Certifcate or PKCS12 File (*.pfx;*.p12) - The file that contains an X.509 certificate along with the private key to establish the secure connection and authentification. 

# Example
This is Jan's WebID: http://holycrab13.github.io/webid.ttl#this
If you open it in a browser or `curl` it the `#this` is ignored and the full turtle file is retrieved. In the turtle file you can find a section with additional information about Jan as well as his public key:
```
<#this> a foaf:Person ;
   foaf:name "Jan Forberg";
   cert:key [ 
       a cert:RSAPublicKey;
       rdfs:label "made on 23 November 2011 on my laptop";
       cert:modulus """00:[....]9b"""^^xsd:hexBinary;
       cert:exponent 65537 ;
      ] .
``` 

# The Rules of WebID
1. The WebID profile document is editable only by its owner or the owning organisation.
2. The WebID profile document is retrievable as Turtle file via HTTP(S) request on the WebID URI. Use of `Accept: text/turtle` header is mandatory for the request.  
3. The WebID profile document `must` contain:
 * A `foaf:primaryTopic` from the WebID profile URI to the WebID.
 * A statement whether the WebID is a `foaf:Person`, `foaf:Organisation` or `foaf:Agent`
 * The modulus and exponent of the RSAPublicKey
4. The WebID profile document `should` be public as in open access like the majority of websites. 
5. The private key as well as the PKCS12 (.pfx,.p12) file `must` be kept in a secure location (normally password protected file or entrusted to a web browser).  
6. The X.509 Certificate, which is part of the PKCS12 file `must` contain the WebID in the `subject alternative name` (SAN) field


Note: The WebID profile document can contain any amount of additional information and extensions in the document. Some applications may require additional information. 

# Setup

## Public/Private Key Generation
### Generation of the private and public key

```
openssl genpkey -algorith, RSA -out private_key.pem -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:2048
openssl rsa -pubout -in private_key.pem -out public_key.pem
```
This will create two files, private_key.pem and public_key.pem

### Modulus and exponent

To output the modulus and exponent, run
```
openssl rsa -pubin -inform PEM -text -noout < public.key
```
## WebID and WebID profile document
### Choose the URI

We currently recommend using github pages as a hosting service for your WebId, since it is freely available. 
Your WebId will then be <YOUR_GITHUB_NAME>.github.io/webid.ttl#this (see example above)

### Create the Turtle document

You can setup your basic turtle profile document as follows

```
@prefix foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/> .
@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .
@prefix cert: <http://www.w3.org/ns/auth/cert#> .
@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .

<> a foaf:PersonalProfileDocument ;
   foaf:maker <#this> ;
   foaf:primaryTopic <#this> .

<#this> a foaf:Person ;
   foaf:name "<YOUR_NAME>";
   cert:key [ 
       a cert:RSAPublicKey;
       rdfs:label "made on 23 November 2011 on my laptop";
       cert:modulus """<YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY_MODULUS>"""^^xsd:hexBinary;
       cert:exponent <YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY_EXPONENT> ;
      ] . 

``` 

Create a new file and name it `webid.ttl`. Post the code above and make sure to replace the sequences <YOUR_NAME>, <YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY_MODULUS> and <YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY_EXPONENT> with your respective information.

### Publish the document

Create a new github repository named <YOUR_GITHUB_NAME>.github.io. Replace <YOUR_GITHUB_NAME> with your actual own github account name. Once the repository is created, load your `webid.ttl` to the repository root. After 30 to 60 seconds your WebId document will be accessible under <YOUR_GITHUB_NAME>.github.io/webid.ttl#this. You can verify this by running the URI in your browser.

## Client Certificate
### Generation of the PKCS12 file 
### Browser installation

# Usage and Validation

## Retrieval of WebID

`curl -H "Accept: text/turtle" "webid-uri"`

## Syntax validation of WebID profile document (Turtle)

## Content validation of WebID

# TODO
```
openssl dgst -sha256 -sign ~/.ssh/$private_key  anyFile.txt  | openssl base64 -out anyFile.signed
```
